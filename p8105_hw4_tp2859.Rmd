# This is Tingcheng's website

Welcome to Tingcheng Pan's website. I am a first year MS student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Department of Environmental Health Data Science. I like to study data science and practice coding skills. It's so excited when I can solve hard problems. Here youâ€™ll find information about my background, experience, and projects.

I enjoy playing games on weekends. Sometimes, I would like to read some books, especially history books to enhance my knowledge and learn from the history people.
